## ToDo
- Error handling: I need to make the frontend_translator correcly handle all errors that come from the GraphQL API. Maybe I should have an error page that it loads.
- There is no password check at login
- We do not correctly display 'Incorrect username message' to the user
- Password security: we currently have it in the URL of the userpage
