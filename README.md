## GraphQL Schema
See ```schema/schema.graphql```

## Desired Improvements
- I want to make a distinction between developer error messaging and user messaging. Currently they go through the same channels and display in the same place in the UI.

## ToDo
- Add mypy typechecks
- Back to homepage button (logout)
- Can just type URL to get behind login screen
- Allow the user to have capital letters in their username
- Update schema.graphql
- Clean up front end html files
